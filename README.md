This is a basic asteroids game.

Right now there is no scoring, no sound, no music, no real effects other than asteroids splitting up.

This was developed as part of a boot.dev course.

I do plan to make inclusions in the future as I am able, but please do not be surprised if nothing happens here for a while!
